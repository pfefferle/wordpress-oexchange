From the website:

> This'll help you get up and running, whether you're a service that can accept content, a site  that has content to share, or a tool of some sort. Remember that OExchange isn't limited to "sharing" things; it applies to any case where one service wants to send URL-based content to another -- microblogging, translating, printing, whatever.
